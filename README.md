# chocovan-plate
A KiCad6 project for creating a choc spacing keyboard plate that is partially compatible with Minivan standard cases. KiCad6 is chosen as the definition platform to simplify the creation of the corresponding PCB.

Included in this project is a KiCad footprint library for creating cut-outs for Kailh Choc switches on the plate.

The generated gerber is suitable for making FR4 plates at PCB shops such as JLCPCB.

To build this project, you will need to either handwire the keyswitches, or alternatively design and build a PCB.
